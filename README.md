# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project assignment for The Odin Project

This is my second attempt in 2024.

## TODO
- [x] I should make it so that you need to hold click and drag to draw instead of just hover/mouseover - this is because when inputting a grid size, if you click to confirm, your cursor will immediately start drawing near the centre of the grid
- [x] Change background colour from red to white
- [x] Allow user to remove and add borders to squares on grid
- [ ] Implement a clear grid function
