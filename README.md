# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project assignment for The Odin Project

Project is officialy finished. It's quite barebones but I plan to return to it soon.

Need to add:

- Colour and style to the page. Fiddle with the grid so that it is larger and dead center
- Tweak the event listener so that it records mousedown instead of mouseover
- Tweak the input so that if a value that is not a number is parsed, it'll leave the grid as it is without running the main createGrid() function
- Add a few more options, like a mode to choose what colour to use, a random colour mode, maybe a mode to randomly create art (how obscene)
- Maybe tweak the button so that instead of taking a keyboard input, it'll use a slider instead. Will have to look into this one.
